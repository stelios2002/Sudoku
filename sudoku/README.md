This is the Supreme Ultimate Sudokusolver 7000 (S.U.S. v.amogus), a helpful and entertaining sudoku solving AI that can help you with your sudokus.



It can solve sudokus quickly and it supports sizes of 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4. 

It can also assist you by giving you hints one by one.

The SUS7000 accepts launching arguments and also takes inputs from the commandline after running.

A valid sudoku input is in this form: (3x3 example)

".96.4...1" "1...6...4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
